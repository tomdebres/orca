# React Performance Audit

Status: in progress
Started: 2026-05-29
Base commit: `b7fe967780` (`origin/main`, release v1.4.35)

## Goal

Scan the full React surface for `$perf` and `$react-useeffect` issues, keep coverage evidence here, and land the fixes as many small PRs with explicit merge-risk notes.

This document is the audit ledger. A section is not considered fully scanned until it has:

1. File inventory checked from the current worktree.
2. `useEffect` / `useLayoutEffect` / `useInsertionEffect` sites classified.
3. Perf-sensitive patterns checked: timers, subscriptions, observers, `JSON.stringify`, storage writes, polling, broad store subscriptions, large list rendering, and render-time derived state.
4. Each suspicious site dispositioned as "no change", "needs PR", or "covered by PR".
5. Merge risk recorded for every PR candidate.

## Scope

React hook call scan uses all repo `*.ts` and `*.tsx` files, then narrows to actual AST hook calls. The React Effect surface found on 2026-05-29 is:

- `src/renderer/src/**`
- `mobile/app/**`
- `mobile/src/**`
- `mobile/packages/expo-two-way-audio/src/hooks.ts`

Comment-only mentions outside those paths were ignored.

Initial inventory:

rg -l "\\b(useEffect|useLayoutEffect|React\\.useEffect|React\\.useLayoutEffect)\\b" -g '*.tsx' -g '*.ts' | sort
```

The exact Effect-site counts above came from a TypeScript AST scan so comment-only mentions are not counted.
